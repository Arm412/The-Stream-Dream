# The Stream Dream

This is a side project I started using Create-React-App. It uses an Express backend server to access the Twitch API and forwards that data to the front end ReactJS application.

## Current functionality

- A user can see what are the Top 20 most viewed games at the moment on Twitch.
- A user can search for a channel and view the channel information.
